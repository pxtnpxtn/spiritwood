    "innovativeSubtitle": "At Helios, our ethos is to provide our clients with a product that is both ecological and timelessly elegant. By using the most advanced renewable energy technologies, we were able to create exceptional watches powered both by natural and artificial light. The watches constantly store energy, thus enabling them to function normally for up to six months after only one hour of exposure to light.  Our technologies, which prolong the durability of the watches indefinitely, eliminate the need for replacement of ecologically harmful batteries altogether. You wonâ€™t have to bring your watch at the store for maintenance anymore (but we all know you were not doing it anyway!)",
    "sustainableTitle": "SUSTAINABLE MATERIAL",
    "sustainableSubtitle": "<<If all the watches that uses batteries were to function with a solar movement, we estimate we could save up to 300 million of batteries per year>>  - By consciously developing our watches with the most sustainable materials, we are ensuring that every single person choosing Helios is part of a larger movement towards a cleaner future.",
    "luxuriousTitle": "LUXURIOUS DESIGN",
    "luxuriousSubtitle": "Your style reflects who you are and what you believe in. Too often we are forced to sacrifice our values of responsible consumerism for style or vice versa. We believe that the leaders of today and tomorrow deserve a product that is both eco-friendly and elegant without breaking the bank. Because we created a watch that can last for ever, we created a design that can go through the times with it. We also made sure you can adapt the style of your Helios with your accoutrement by easily swapping the straps. It is about time that we prioritize sustainability in our everyday decisions in order to usher in a new era of responsible consumption."
